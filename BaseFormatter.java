 * This program converts numbers into different bases, like binary or hexadecimal, using the BaseFormatter class.
 * It checks that the base is between 2 and 36, and if not, it throws an error.
 * The class follows rules from an interface, NumberFormatter, meaning it has to include a specific format method to change how numbers look.
